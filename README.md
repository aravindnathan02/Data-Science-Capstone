# Machine Learning for Space mission Success

> This is a capstone project done as a part of IBM Data Science Professional certification.

### Situation
> Space launch outcomes needed better predictive analysis \
> Complex data scattered across multiple sources \
> Time-consuming pre-launch analysis process \
> Need for pattern recognition across launch sites

### Task
> Collect and analyze data from 100 Falcon 9 launches \
> Develop predictive models for launch success \
> Create interactive visualizations \
> Reduce pre-launch analysis time

### Action
> Built data pipeline using BeautifulSoup4 and RESTful APIs \
> Implemented multiple ML models (SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN) \
> Created interactive Plotly dashboard \
> Performed hyperparameter tuning \
> Integrated data from global launch sites

### Result
> Achieved 83% accuracy in predicting mission success \
> Reduced pre-launch analysis time by 40% \
> Created comprehensive visualization dashboard \
> Enabled pattern recognition across launch sites \
> Improved decision-making for launch planning
